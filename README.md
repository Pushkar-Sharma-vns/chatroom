# chatroom
- This GitHub repository contains a Django Channels-based chat room application with WebSocket functionality.
- The application has a user-friendly front page and includes sign up, log out, and log in functionalities for users to interact with the chat room.
- It provides a separate app for managing chat rooms, allowing users to create, view, and participate in various rooms.
- To get started, a superuser can be created to manage the chat room application.
- The application displays a list of available chat rooms, and users can view detailed information about each room.
- It implements consumers to handle WebSocket connections, enabling real-time communication and chat functionality.
- Users can join the chat room and send messages to communicate with other participants.
- Messages are efficiently stored and retrieved to maintain conversation history.
- The chat interface automatically scrolls to the bottom for a seamless user experience.
- This project serves as a robust foundation for creating scalable and interactive chat room applications using Django Channels and WebSocket technology.
